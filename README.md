# Cowrie-Log-file-grabber
For personal Cowrie setup only.

Bash script that uses regex to copy log files with contents matching the specified pattern.

Currently only outputs contents of all log files in a directory

**TO DO**

Add regex file parsing capabilities.
Copy pattern-matching files to a seperate directory.
Alternative option to copy files based on date/time rather than regex pattern.

*OPTIONAL*: Ability to copy files matching BOTH regex pattern and date/time.
