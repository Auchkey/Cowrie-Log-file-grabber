# Cowrie-Log-file-grabber
For personal Cowrie setup only.

Bash script that uses regex to copy log files with contents matching the specified pattern.

Currently accepts basic regex from the user to use against detected log files in the same directory. Doesn't do anything with them yet.

**TO DO**

Copy pattern matching files to a seperate directory.
